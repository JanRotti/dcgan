# Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network
This code is part of my project work in generating synthetic Ground Penetrating Radar Grams
using Generative Adversarial Networks. 

### Installation

The model requirements are given in the requirements.txt file.
The most important dependency is pytorch 1.7.1

Install the dependencies in your local environment.

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### General Useage

Training the model

```sh
$ python model.py
```

Reset Standard Model

```sh
$ python reset.py
```

Generate samples
```sh
$ python sample_model.py
```

### Dataset
Create "/data" and place your own dataset in it. The subfolder structure is irrelevant.
